Due to licensing restrictions, Coherence JARs cannot be distributed with this benchmark framework.  To enable benchmarking
Coherence, download the Coherence JAR files from Oracle's website:

    http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/products/ias/htdocs/coherence.html

Put the JAR files in the lib/ directory, and then re-run "ant clean all" from the benchmark's root directory to build
and enable Coherence benchmarking.

1.  Replace cluster.sh, runNode.sh, killNode.sh and cache-product/product-x.y.z/config.sh with Ant scripts to make them cross-platform.
2. status email notifications - will allow one not to tail logs all the time/from time to time to look for issues
3. move scripts to an bin dir, as there are too many of them arround
4. warmup should only be performed if session replication passes

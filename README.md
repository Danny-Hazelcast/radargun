# RadarGun

RadarGun is a data grid and distributed cache benchmarking framework built to test [Infinispan](http://www.infinispan.org) and other distributed data grid platforms.

## Documentation

All information on this framework, including usage, is maintained online, on [the project's wiki system](https://github.com/infinispan/radargun/wiki).

## Quick start:

To build, run:

    $ mvn clean install

and the distribution will be built in ``target/distribution`` which can then be used to perform benchmarks.
